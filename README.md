# ESP32 Labs Project

This repository contains four small projects implemented on ESP32 microcontrollers.

## Lab 1 - ESP32 IDE LED

Simulation of LED blinking using ESP32 on Wokwi platform. The goal is to familiarize with ESP32 simulation.

## Lab 2 - ESP32 with Blynk

Fire alarm system and fire extinguisher activation. Monitoring and control via Blynk. OLED display for system operation visualization.

## Lab 3 - ESP Thingspeak

Sending real-time data from DHT22 sensor with time updates from DS1307 to ThingSpeak.

## Lab 4 - ESP Firebase

Synchronization of data from DHT22 and HCSR04 sensors to Firebase. Additionally, toggling LED if data retrieved from Firebase indicates temperature above 30Â°C, humidity below 20%, and distance less than 30cm.

Each lab folder contains detailed instructions and necessary files for setup and execution.
